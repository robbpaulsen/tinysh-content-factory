image:
  model: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell-Free"
  style: "Create a cinematic image in a dramatic, high-contrast photographic style, with a cool blue color grading. The subject is a figure [doing something, like walking under a waterfall, sitting under a tree, watching the sunset, whatever makes sense from the content's perspective], captured from a distance. The foreground should be softly blurred to focus attention on the landscape details. The mood should convey strength, wisdom, and a sense of calm determination. The overall visual should feel inspirational and dignified, resembling a powerful nature documentary scene."
