# Image generation (FLUX)
image:
  model: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell-Free"
  style: "Create a photorealistic, cinematic image in a dramatic, high-contrast style. Apply a cool blue color grading, subtly accented with elegant green and gold tones to represent wealth. The scene features a mysterious professional figure **seen strictly from behind or in silhouette**, ensuring **no facial features are visible**. The figure is [standing on a balcony overlooking a blurred city skyline at night, observing a large holographic market chart projected on a glass wall, or walking through a modern corridor towards a bright light representing future success]. The composition uses a 'shallow depth of field' to keep the background softly blurred, emphasizing the atmosphere and the figure's posture rather than their identity. The visual language must be strictly atmospheric and narrative, **avoiding any text, logos, icons, or graphical overlays**. The mood creates a sense of calm determination, wisdom, and financial strategy, evoking the aesthetic of a high-end financial documentary."
